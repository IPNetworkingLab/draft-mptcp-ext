1.  Introduction

   This document addresses an important limitation of Multipath TCP
   [RFC8684]: the exchange of plain text keys during the handshake.

   From a security viewpoint, Multipath TCP is vulnerable to on-path
   attacks [RFC6181].  Since Multipath TCP relies on keys that are
   exchanged in clear during the handshake, an on-path attacker can
   easily collect the authentication keys and later establish a subflow
   on an existing Multipath TCP connection.  If this connection is used
   to support secure protocols such as TLS [RFC8446] or SSH [RFC4253],
   the attacker will only be able to disrupt the connection.

   This document proposes a modification to the MP_CAPABLE and MP_JOIN
   options that enables Multipath TCP hosts to use keys that are derived
   by upper layer protocols such as TLS or SSH.  This idea has already
   been discussed in the past [I-D.paasch-mptcp-ssl-00],
   [I-D.paasch-mptcp-application-authentication-00] and
   [I-D.paasch-mptcp-tls-authentication-00].  We provide an overview of
   this extension in Section 3 and describe the protocol modifications
   in Section 4.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Protocol overview

   This document proposes an extension that allows Multipath TCP to use
   either a pre-configured key or a key derived by an upper layer
   security protocol to authenticate the advertisement of additional
   addresses, the establishment of new subflows, and the abrupt closure
   of a whole connection.  This extension is negotiated during the
   establishment of the Multipath TCP connection by setting the TBD bit
   in the MP_CAPABLE option.  This is illustrated in Figure 1.

   Host A                                  Host B
   ------                                  ------
   MP_CAPABLE                ->
   [flags (TBD is set)]
                             <-            MP_CAPABLE
                                           [B's token, flags (TBD is set)]
   ACK + MP_CAPABLE (+ data) ->
   [A's token, B's token, flags, (data-level details)]

      Figure 1: Negotiation of the utilization of external keys

   If the TBD flag is set and the responder supports the option, it
   returns an MP_CAPABLE that contains the 32-bit token that it uses to
   identify this connection.  The connection initiator replies with an
   MP_CAPABLE option containing its 32-bit token and the remote 32-bit
   token.

   This modification has two important advantages compared to Multipath
   TCP version 1 [RFC8684].  First, the MP_CAPABLE option is shorter.
   It contains only two 32-bit tokens instead of two 64-bit keys in the
   third ACK.  Second, the token is not derived from a random key using
   a hash function.  This implies that there is no risk of collision
   between a new key and a token used for an existing connection.  The
   token must uniquely identify the associated connection and should be
   selected randomly [RFC4086].

   After the handshake, host A and host B cannot create additional
   subflows or exchange additional addresses.  These operations can only
   occur once they have agreed on an external key.  Once a host has
   learned an external key (e.g. through configuration, socket option,
   or derived from a security protocol), it SHOULD inform the other by
   sending a hash of this key in a NEW_KEY option a shown in Figure 2.
   The key is installed once a host has received a hash of the key from
   the other host.

   Security protocols need to change keys regularly for security
   reasons.  Multipath TCP version 1 [RFC8684] does not support changing
   the security keys.  This extension uses a key identifier to support
   key changes.  All authenticated options contain the K bit which is
   the identifier of the key used to authenticate it.  The initial
   external key corresponds to identifier 0.

      Host A                                  Host B
      ------                                  ------
      NEW_KEY [K,hash(ExtKey)]         ->

                                     <-       NEW_KEY[K,hash(ExtKey)]

      Figure 2: Confirmation of the utilization of a new external key

   The key identifier is included in the modified ADD_ADDR, MP_JOIN and
   FASTCLOSE options described later in this document.

4.  Changes to Multipath TCP

   This section describes the changes to the Multipath TCP options that
   are required to support external keys.

4.1.  Extending the MP_CAPABLE and MP_JOIN options

   [RFC8684] defines the MP_CAPABLE option as shown in Figure 3.

                            1                   2                   3

       |                   Option Sender's Key (64 bits)               |
       |                      (if option Length > 4)                   |
       |                                                               |
       +---------------------------------------------------------------+
       |                  Option Receiver's Key (64 bits)              |
       |                      (if option Length > 12)                  |
       |                                                               |
       +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
       |  Data-Level Length (16 bits)  |  Checksum (16 bits, optional) |
       +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+

                Figure 3: The MP_CAPABLE option in RFC8684

   This option contains several flags, A-H.  Flags A, B, C, and H are
   specified in [RFC8684].  This document changes the TBD Flag.  If this
   Flag is set in a SYN, this indicates the utilization of external
   keys.  An external key is a key which is either known, e.g. by
   configuration as a shared secret, or derived from a negotiated secure
   key, e.g. by protocols such as SSH or TLS.  This key is used as an
   authentication key for the establishment of additional subflows.

   A Multipath TCP implementation maintains two 64-bit keys:

   *  a local key chosen by the host and exchanged during the handshake

   *  a remote key learned during the handshake

   As specified in [RFC8684], a local 32-bit token and a remote 32-bit
   token are derived from these keys.  The keys and the token are known
   at the end of the handshake.

   When the external keys are used, the situation is different.  The
   connection initiator sends an empty MP_CAPABLE option in its SYN
   segment.  A responder that receives a SYN with the MP_CAPABLE option
   having the TBD bit set responds with an MP_CAPABLE option and the TBD
   bit set if it supports the external keys.  Otherwise, it replies with
   an MP_CAPABLE option whose TBD bit is reset and follows the procedure
   defined in [RFC8684].

   If the responder replies with an MP_CAPABLE option whose TBD Flag is
   set, the option in the SYN+ACK contains the 32-bit token that it uses
   to identify this connection.

   Upon reception of the SYN+ACK, the connection initiator replies with
   a third ACK that contains an MP_CAPABLE option with the TBD bit set.
   This option contains the initiator and the responder tokens.

       |                      (if option Length > 4)                   |

       |                  Option Receiver's Token (32 bits)            |
       |                      (if option Length > 8)                   |
       +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
       |  Data-Level Length (16 bits)  |  Checksum (16 bits, optional) |
       +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+

                 Figure 4: The modified MP_CAPABLE option

   If the TBD bit was set in the MP_CAPABLE option of the SYN+ACK, this
   indicates that there are no security keys associated with the
   connection.  This implies that it is impossible to advertise
   addresses or join an additional subflow until external keys have been
   exchanged.

4.2.  Changing the external key

   Once the Multipath TCP connection has been established, the
   applications can decide to use an external key.

   Once the hosts have agreed on an external key to use to authenticate
   the MP_JOIN, ADD_ADDR, and MP_FASTCLOSE options on a connection, they
   inform the other host by sending a NEW_KEY option.  This option is
   shown in Figure 5.

                            1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +---------------+---------------+-------+-----+-+---------------+
       |  NEW_KEY      |  Length = 12  |Subtype|(rsv)|K|       0       |
       +---------------+---------------+-------+-----+-+---------------+
       |               Low order HMAC of the external key              |
       |                           (64 bits)                           |
       +---------------------------------------------------------------+

                       Figure 5: The NEW_KEY option

   This new option contains two pieces of information:

   *  a one-bit key identifier (K)

   *  a 64-bit HMAC of the external key

   The key identifier identifies the last key exchanged on a connection.
   The key identifiers start at 0, i.e. the first NEW_KEY option
   contains the K bit set to zero.  The 64-bit HMAC contains the low
   order 64 bits of a HMAC of the external key computed using the
   negotiated hash algorithm.  The key for this HMAC, in the case of a
   message transmitted by Host A, is Token-A followed by Token-B; and in
   the case of Host B, Key-B followed by Key-A.  The "message" for the
   HMAC algorithm in each case is the external key.

   Once a host has sent a NEW_KEY option, it SHOULD start a timer.  If
   it does not receive an option containing the same hash value, it
   should retransmit the option.

   A host must store two external keys:

   *  the current one

   *  the next key

   A key is considered to be active once a host has received a NEW_KEY
   option containing a HMAC of this key.  If a host receives a NEW_KEY
   option whose HMAC and key identifier do not match the stored ones, it
   simply discards the option.

4.3.  Using the external key

   While Multipath TCP version 1 uses two different keys announced by
   the communicating hosts, the external key is a key shared by both
   hosts.  [RFC8684] defined several procedures that rely on these two
   keys to authenticate the establishment of subflows using the MP_JOIN
   option, the advertisement for new addresses, or the fast termination
   of a connection.

   These procedures change with an external key.  The first modification
   is that these options now contain a K bit that indicates the
   identifier of the external key used to (request to) authenticate the
   option.  The second modification is that instead of computing HMACs
   over KeyA||KeyB, the HMACs defined in [RFC8684] are now computed
   using the external key whose identifier is K.

   The new format of the MP_JOIN option is shown in Figure 6.

                            1                   2                   3

       |                Sender's Random Number (32 bits)               |
       +---------------------------------------------------------------+

                  Figure 6: The modified MP_JOIN option

   The new format of the ADD_ADDR option is shown in Figure 7.

     |                Truncated HMAC (8 octets, if E=0)              |

     |                               |
     +-------------------------------+

                   Figure 7: The modified ADD_ADDR option

   The modified format of the MP_FASTCLOSE option is shown in Figure 8.
   This option does no longer contain the receivers' key as in
   [RFC8684].  Instead, it contains a truncated HMAC of the external
   key.  The key for this HMAC is, in the case of a message transmitted
   by Host A, Token-A followed by Token-B; and in the case of Host B,
   Token-B followed by Token-A.  The "message" for the HMAC algorithm
   is, in each case, the external key.  The K bit indicates the
   corresponding key identifier.

   A host can still reset an MPTCP connection before the initial
   external keys got exchanged, while there is only one subflow then.
   This SHOULD be done by sending a TCP RST.

5.  Security Considerations

   The solution proposed in this document aims at preventing the attacks
   where an on-path attacker observes the keys associated with a
   Multipath TCP connection.  Since these keys are not exposed anymore,
   attackers cannot use them to add subflows to an existing Multipath
   TCP connection.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the IANA to reserve flag TBD of the MP_CAPABLE
   option as defined in this document.  It proposes to use the E flag.
   It also proposes to add the K bit to the MP_JOIN, ADD_ADDR, and
   MP_FASTCLOSE options.  Finally, it defines the NEW_KEY option.
   Subtype 0x9 is suggested for this option.
